## Turn heimdall config dir into tra archive

Since `./etc/heimdall/config` not only contains config files but php
code as well this directory is turned into a tar archive and is
extracted during lab startup.

Add `./etc/heimdall` and `./etc/heimdall.tar` to .gitignore.

## Add monitoring stack

Add monitoring stack consisting of Grafana / Prometheus / Loki /
cAdvisor. This stack enables the user to track logs and performance
metrics of vulnerable applications while attacking these.

For this stack to work:

- Add function to install Loki Docker Diver Docker plugin.
- Add logging config to every victim service.
- Add config files for Loki / Grafana / Prometheus.

Further changes:

- Fix Makefile to lint all yaml files.
- Add kali Dockerfile to gitignore so personal changes do not affect git
  status if not wanted.
- Clean up `./etc` dir.
    - Because many more ressources were added to `./etc` specific
      directories for specific services were added.
- Update README with new features.
- Update `lab.sh` and `src/labctl.bash` to comply with new structure of
  `./etc`.
- Add screenshots to README.
